# Description
A DB Search Engine, based of PHP


# Comments to the the project:
This is an bad Database Search Engine for School.
It's made an login, log out function in it.

It was made in 2015-2016 (Autumn & Spring).
I Stopped project because... Don't really need it anymore, So I release it for anyone to use and change.
Everything is in Norwegian, so change it to English.. had lots of problems with Norwegian to work with the buttons when I worked with PHP... But I guessing the blame goes to 000webhost not supporting norwegian utf-8.

I was using 000webhost for this project for testing out everything on it. (Cause it had PHP, PHPmyAdmin, SQL, and a little space for my little project with 1,000 students that I tested it with.)

# Programs Used:
- Notepad ++
- If I would say, I Suggest XAMPP or WAMP for usage as local webserver, But Instead I used simply 000webhost.com

# Latest version:
- Patch v.3 (Find it in branches)

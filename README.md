A DB Search Engine, based of PHP

Comments to the the project:

This is an bad Database Search Engine for School. It's made an login, log out function in it.

It was made in 2015-2016 (Autumn & Spring). I Stopped project because... Don't really need it anymore, So I release it for anyone to use and change. Everything is in Norwegian, so change it to English.. had lots of problems with Norwegian to work with the buttons when I worked with PHP... But I guessing the blame goes to 000webhost not supporting norwegian utf-8.

I was using 000webhost for this project for testing out everything on it. (Cause it had PHP, PHPmyAdmin, SQL, and a little space for my little project with 1,000 students that I tested it with.)

Programs Used:

Notepad ++
If I would say, I Suggest XAMPP or WAMP for usage as local webserver, But Instead I used simply 000webhost.com
Latest version:

Patch v.3 (Find it in branches)
